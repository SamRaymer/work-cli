## Installation

‚è∞ I'm busy, can I paste in 1 line of shell code?

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbalatero/work-cli/main/bin/install)
```

ü§ì I'm paranoid about running code directly from curl:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbalatero/work-cli.git ~/.work-cli

cd ~/.work-cli
bin/install       # don't forget to audit the script, you nerd
```

## FAQ

### I forget how to quit Vim, can I use VSCode to edit my PR descriptions?

Sure, why not. Just add this to your `bashrc/zshrc/whatever` file and reload
your shell:

```bash
export EDITOR="code --wait"
```
